<h2 style="max-width: 40rem;margin-inline: auto;">All auditing account types are considered part of the core of ReviewMate's auditing system that covers many features such as:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Customizable settings for overall accuracy rates</li>
    <li>Grouping and pricing take place within the software eliminating the need for auditor to “toggle” between an encoder and ReviewMate for better resequencing decisions.</li>
    <li>Full suite of references including Coding Clinic, CPT Assistant, Coding Clinic for HCPCS, Clinotes, Principal Diagnosis Analysis, DRG Analysis, AHA Coding Handbook, and code look-up eliminating the need for auditors to access an outside product to perform research.</li>
    <li>Full suite of edits/warnings including gender and age conflicts, MCE edits, critical error and TruCode warnings.</li>
    <li>Reconciliation of rebuttals occurs inside of ReviewMate.</li>
    <li> Conversations between the auditor and coder are saved in a chronological manner and can be accessed by any user.</li>
    <li>Accuracy rates available real-time and can be sliced and diced to accommodate different situations and date patterns.</li>
    <li> Extensive library of customizable and exportable reports from raw data to Executive Summaries.</li>
    <li>Customizable dashboards to enhance the user experience.</li>
    <li>Multiple user levels allow view-only access to any interested parties providing transparency within your organization.</li>
    <li> “Audit the Auditor” available for a higher-level quality check of any audit in ReviewMate.</li>
  </ul>
