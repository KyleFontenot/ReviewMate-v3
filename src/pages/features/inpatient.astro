      <p>The Inpatient (IPPS) Module in ReviewMate provides accuracy rates for all audited elements, communication between the auditor and coder, a library of available reports that can be customized and exported, and an "Audit the Auditor" option.</p>
      <p>The IPPS (Facility Inpatient) auditing module of ReviewMate provides accuracy rates for all elements including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li >MS-DRG (Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups)</li>
      <li>APR-DRG (All Patients Refined Diagnosis Related Groups - Copyright 3M)</li>
      <li>SOI (Severity of Illness - Copyright 3M)</li>
      <li>ROM (Risk of Mortality - Copyright 3M)</li>
      <li>Diagnosis (ICD-10-CM or ICD-9-CM)</li>
      <li>Principal Diagnosis</li>
      <li>Secondary Diagnosis</li>
      <li>POA (Present on Admission)</li>
      <li>Discharge Disposition</li>
      <li>Procedure (ICD-10-PCS)</li>
      <li>CPT/HCPCS (Current Procedural Terminology/Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System - optional)</li>
      <li>Procedure Provider</li>
      <li>Procedure Date</li>
      <li>MCC (Major Comorbidity or Complication)</li>
      <li>CC (Comorbidity or Complication)</li>
      <li>CMS-HCC (Heirarchical Condition Category)</li>
      <li>HAC (Hospital Acquired Condition)</li>
      <li>Customizable Overall Accuracy Rate</li>
      <li>Both MS-DRG and APR-DRG grouping and pricing take place within the software eliminating the need for auditor to “toggle” between an encoder and ReviewMate. This also eliminates the need for auditors to re-enter codes and demographics into an encoder/grouper to make resequencing decisions.</li>
      <li>Full suite of references including Coding Clinic, CPT Assistant, Coding Clinic for HCPCS, Clinotes, Principal Diagnosis Analysis, DRG Analysis, AHA Coding Handbook, and code look-up eliminating the need for auditors to access an outside product to perform research.</li>
      <li>Identification on the screen of codes with MCC/CC/HAC and CMS-HCC values.</li>
      <li>Full suite of edits/warnings including gender and age conflicts, MCE edits, critical error and TruCode warnings.</li>
      <li>Reconciliation of rebuttals occurs inside of ReviewMate.</li>
      <li>Conversations between the auditor and coder are saved in a chronological manner and can be accessed by any user.</li>
      <li>Accuracy rates available real-time and can be sliced and diced to accommodate different situations and date patterns.</li>
      <li>Extensive library of customizable and exportable reports from raw data to Executive Summaries.</li>
      <li>Customizable dashboards to enhance the user experience.</li>
      <li>Multiple user levels allow view-only access to any interested parties providing transparency within your organization.</li>
      <li>“Audit the Auditor” available for a higher-level quality check of any audit in ReviewMate.</li>
      <li>Support for Profee audit within the IPPS module.</li>
    </ul>
